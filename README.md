# 1.1-ugly-website

* This is an ugly Drake-themed website. I built this project on Day 1, Week 1 of my time at The Iron Yard to practice basic HTML and CSS concepts. There is a link in the description to a deployed version of the project and you can clone the project if you'd like to get it working locally.
